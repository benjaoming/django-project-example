# A Django project with a few important opinions

The point of this repository is to illustrate a Blog post and to prove that it's very easy to bootstrap new Django projects in the modern era.

By now, the best practices have settled and very little modification to the tools are needed to get you to where you wanna be.

Cookie-cutter has been great, but we can do with less. Everything is opinionated, so is this - but hopefully you need to just add things that you will want to add, and not reconfigure too much.

## Prerequisites

You need:

* uv: `pipx install uv` (or something similar)
* Django: `uvx install django` (django version doesn't really matter, but latest is greatest)

## Usage

You can create your new project by running ./startproject.sh name-of-project
