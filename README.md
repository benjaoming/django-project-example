# A Django project with a few important opinions

The point of this repository is to illustrate a Blog post and to prove that it's very easy to bootstrap new Django projects in the modern era.

By now, the best practices have settled and very little modification to the tools are needed to get you to where you wanna be.

[Cookie-cutter](https://www.cookiecutter.io/) templates are great, but in this example, we have less needs. Everything is opinionated, so is this - but hopefully you need to just add things that you will want to add, and not reconfigure too much.

## Prerequisites

You need:

* uv: `pipx install uv` (or [another method to install it](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/))

## Usage

You can create your new project by running `./startproject.sh name-of-project`
